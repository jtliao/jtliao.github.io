I created a player comparison tool that takes the basic statistics of every player into a database, and then calculates the closest statistical player to an inputted player using an algorithm that involves z-scores. The results lead to some interesting findings.

Input: LeBron James

Output: Eric Bledsoe

LeBron and his buddy "Mini-LeBron", as deemed by his teammates, are matched with each other, interestingly enough. The two do share similar skillsets and statlines despite their positional difference, with both being all-around players without great shooting.

Input: Carmelo Anthony

Output:Rudy Gay

Rudy Gay is probably the first person that comes to mind when I think of Carmelo, so the comparer does its job here, as the two do share very similar statlines.

Input: Stephen Curry

Output: Tony Allen

Woah. These two would definitely not be associated with each other, as they have nearly opposite skillsets. But, these two are matched with each other, showing the mystery of statistics sometimes.

Input: John Wall

Output: Jeff Teague

We have two very similar players here, slashing guards who distribute often. Nothing to see here, the algorithm is working fairly well.

Input: Anthony Davis

Output: DeMarcus Cousins

These two young players will likely be battling for the next decade, they are looking to be the best big men of the next era. Both are a plus on offense and defense, though Davis excels on defense and Cousins in the low post.
