The Warriors have arrived. After years of watching the dynamic offense flirt with playoff success,the team has finally emerged as a true championship contender as we near the midway point of the season. Along with its flashy offense led by the Splash Brothers,the defense of the Warriors has ballooned the team to the top record in the league. The addition of head coach Steve Kerr and the defensively oriented assistant Ron Adams have made the team a defensive juggernaut,tops in the league in field goal percentage allowed and defensive rating.

The bulk of the Warriors success comes in the form of their perimeter defense. The team is loaded with skilled perimeter defenders such as Klay Thompson and Andre Iguodala, along with their flexible defensive ace, Draymond Green. These players are all able to keep their opponents in front of them,making them settle for jumpers instead of driving to the hoop. This combination of talent has forced opponents into an inefficient style of basketball, one of low percentage jump shots. The team allows the 6th most jumpers in the league, forcing them to shoot at a 34.4% clip on these shots, lowest in the league. In addition,these jumpers are generally two-pointers rather than threes, as the Warriors hover around the league average in threes allowed. This style of defense allows the team to maintain its low field goal percentage allowed, as opposing teams continually have to take poor shots.

Because opponents have been forced to take so many jumpers,the Warriors have been able to cut down on easy points,with the team having the 6th fewest layups attempted against them.However, even when opponents are able to get to the rim,the Warriors remain difficult to score against, only allowing a 55.4% field goal percentage at the rim, 6th in the league. Still,these numbers can be improved on, as they have been without their main rim protector, Andrew Bogut, for a large part of the season.

Additionally,the quick hands of players like Stephen Curry and Draymond Green have allowed for numerous opportunities for steals, as the Warriors are 3rd in the league in the category.

Green’s defensive versatility can be seen here, as his quick reactions provide several opportunities for the team to get out on the break and run,where the Warriors are tops in the league.Green, despite being a power forward for the team, is able to switch onto nearly any guard or wing without surrendering his defensive advantage,making him a very valuable defensive asset (large payday incoming?).

Despite the success the Warriors have achieved so far,there is still room for improvement. Turnovers have been a frequent issue for the team so far, as they make the 5th most turnovers in the league per 100 possessions. These turnovers make it difficult for the defense to recover, as the team allows 18.58 points off these turnovers per game, 3rd most in the league.Cutting back on these giveaways can further improve the defense, along with giving the offense more opportunities to score.

Though the team remains a jump-shooting team,the transformation of the defense into the best in the league bodes well for the team in the playoffs.On nights when their jumpers simply aren’t falling,they have something else to rely on,their ability to prevent opponents from knocking down shots too.
