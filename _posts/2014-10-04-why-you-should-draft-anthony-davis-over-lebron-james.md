The NBA season is around the corner, with the preseason already underway. And, with the NBA season, comes the always exciting fantasy basketball season.

The first pick in most leagues will be fairly obvious, as Kevin Durant is widely accepted as the best fantasy basketball player in the league. But, the second pick becomes a bit more fuzzy. For some, the obvious choice is LeBron James, after all, how can you pass on picking the best player in the world? Here's how: by picking the true second best player in fantasy- Anthony Davis.

Unbeknownst to many, Davis was already the second best fantasy player in 9-category leagues last year. Davis' numbers along with the subsequent z-scores (essentially, how good Davis was relative to the rest of the league, higher is better, 0 is the league average) follow:

Category | PTS | 3PM | REB | AST | STL | BLK | FG% | FT% | TO
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Season Average | 20.81 | 0.03 | 10.04 | 1.57 | 1.33 | 2.82 | 0.52 | 0.79 | 1.63
Z-Scores | 1.31 | -1.23 | 1.69 | -0.71 | 0.72 | 3.94 | 1.40 | 0.25 | 0.32

The z-score adds up to a total of 7.7, or 0.86 per category. In statistical terms, Davis was 0.86 standard deviations higher than the league average per category.

On the other hand, James' numbers were:

Category | PTS | 3PM | REB | AST | STL | BLK | FG% | FT% | TO
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Season Average | 27.13 | 1.51 | 6.92 | 6.34 | 1.57 | 0.34 | 0.57 | 0.75 | 3.51
Z-Scores | 2.63 | 0.51 | 0.51 | 1.50 | 1.27 | -0.54 | 3.12 | -0.57 | -2.1

This only adds up to 6.28, or 0.69 per category. In this sense, Davis was 0.17 standard deviations better than James in each category.

Already, Davis is the better fantasy basketball player than James, but I feel Davis has only more room to grow and further exceed his lead over James.

Over the offseason, the Pelicans made a key acquisition in trading for former Rocket Omer Asik. Asik is known more for his defense and rebounding than his scoring ability, both of which will boost Davis' fantasy value.

In terms of offense, Davis likely won't be affected, since Asik isn't one to require offensive plays for him, leading to no change from Pelican centers from last season.
Asik's defensive presence will likely be the most beneficial to Davis' value, as Davis greatly benefited in his block and steal numbers when playing with true centers last year.

Statistic | With Center | Without Center | % Increase
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Blocks/100 | Possessions | 3.8 | 4.4 | 16%
Steals/100 | Possessions | 1.9 | 2.3 | 21%


By finding Davis' stats when playing with centers Alexis Ajinca, Greg Steimsma, Jason Smith, or Jeff Withey, we see that Davis' defensive numbers benefited from playing with a true center. Omer Asik is a better defender than all of these players, so Davis' defensive numbers may further increase from the ridiculous numbers they were at last year.

In addition, All-Star point guard Jrue Holiday was injured for a majority of last season. When he did play, however, Davis thrived:


Category | Without Holiday | With Holiday | % Increase
 --- | --- | --- | ---
Field Goal % | 51.2 | 53.4 | 4.3%
Usage Rate | 23.9 | 25 | 4.6%
Points/Possession | 1.17 | 1.19 | 2.0%

Davis clearly benefited from playing with his talented guard, as the increased offensive pressure of the team as a whole likely opened up higher percentage shots for Davis. A full season of Holiday would likely boost Davis' offensive stats.

Lastly, Davis is still only 21, and constantly improving his game. It was reported that Davis was working on implementing a corner-3 into his offensive arsenal (is that even fair?). If Davis is actually able to start knocking down 3s, his fantasy value would skyrocket even further, probably into first overall pick status.

These factors, along with the possibility of a decline in James' numbers due to joining the Cavaliers, make a strong argument that Davis should be drafted ahead of James in fantasy basketball leagues.
