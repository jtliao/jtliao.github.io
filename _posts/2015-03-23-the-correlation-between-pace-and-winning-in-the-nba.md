title: "The Correlation Between Pace and Winning in the NBA"

With teams like the 76ers experimenting with a high-pace style, I was curious if pace had any sort of correlation to winning.

I found the correlation coefficients between pace and win% from the 2008-2009 season until this point in the season.

For those unfamiliar with the correlation coefficient, it is on a scale of -1 to 1, with 1 meaning that they are totally positively correlated (as x increases, y increases), 0 meaning they are not correlated at all (x and y are unrelated), and -1 meaning they are totally negatively correlated (as x increases, y decreases).

Though the correlations coefficients are very low, we do see a pattern. From 2008-2011, there is a negative correlation between pace and win%, suggesting that higher pace was more indicative of a worse team than a better one. From that point on, the correlation coefficient has increased, all the way to a positive value this season. We see teams like Houston and Golden State leading the league in pace, doing so while performing extremely well in the tough West. We will have to wait and see if this year is simply an outlier, or if pace will continue to increase its correlation with winning in future seasons.

Overall, the average pace in the league has been fairly consistent, as seen by the second graph. It has seemed to increase over the past few seasons, though these changes are only increases by a few percent.
