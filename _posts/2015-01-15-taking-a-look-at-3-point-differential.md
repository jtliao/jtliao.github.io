Over the past few years, the league has moved toward one of 3 pointers, with teams taking and making record numbers of 3s. With this movement has come its fair share of doubters, with names like Sam Amico receiving heat for tweets like these: https://twitter.com/SamAmicoFSO/status/553772620366491648 .

But, do all of these 3s taken lead to wins? I took a look at the 3 point differential of a team (3 pointers made minus 3 pointers allowed), and compared it to the team's win percentage.

The positive trend this season is much more distinct than last season, as there is a fairly clear correlation between 3 point differential and win percentage. In general, teams that are making more threes than their opponents are winning more games. And while there is less of distinction in the correlation in the 2013-2014 season, the top teams in 3 point differential did have a solid amount of success, with San Antonio, #4 in differential, eventually winning the title.

Teams with high 3 point differentials this season, like Houston, Golden State, and Portland, have achieved a large amount of success so far, and this season's playoffs will likely determine if we can rid of the "3 point shots don't win championships" statement for good.
